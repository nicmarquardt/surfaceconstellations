# SurfaceConstellations
A Modular Hardware Platform for  Ad-Hoc Reconfigurable Cross-Device Workspaces

SurfaceConstellations is a modular hardware platform for linking multiple mobile devices to easily create novel cross-device workspace environments. Our platform combines the advantages of multi-monitor workspaces and multi-surface environments with the flexibility and extensibility of more recent cross-device setups. The SurfaceConstellations platform includes a comprehensive library of 3D-printed link modules to connect and arrange tablets into new workspaces, the source code of the OpenSCAD models, a visual configuration tool for automatically generating link modules. For further information about the detailed design space of cross-device workspaces, a technique for capacitive links between tablets for automatic recognition of connected devices, designs of flexible joint connections, and detailed explanations of the physical design of 3D printed brackets and support structures, please refer to our publication at ACM CHI 2018 (link TBA).
